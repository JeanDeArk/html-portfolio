<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>
        It's a classic. Best of all, it's one Ghibli's best productions ever.
        The soundtracks are incredible and only add to the emotional journey
        that is Spirited Away.

<h3>The Day After Tomorrow</h3>
    <p>
        This movie is a masterpiece. It is beautifully executed, and tells a story
        about one of many natural disasters that may arise if our consumption of
        carbon fuels isn't addressed within one or two generations.

<h3>Ip Man</h3>
    <p>
        This movie is meant for martial arts and action movie fanatics. Depicting
        the story of the greatest martial artists to ever live, it shows how
        much the cast cared and respected the Grand Martial Arts Master Ip Man.
